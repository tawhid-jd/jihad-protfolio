                <h2> Vladimir Putin</h2>
                <h3>Leading from 2008| End 2024</h3>
                <img src="images/download.jfif" alt="">

                <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has led the former Soviet Union since the turn of the century, when
                    U.S.
                    President Bill Clinton was preparing to hand over power to George W. Bush. Putin, expected to win a
                    fourth term that would end in 2024, was term-limited in 2008 and spent four years as prime minister
                    before returning to the presidency in 2012.

                    Putin may become the longest-serving Russian leader since dictator Joseph Stalin, but there are
                    world
                    leaders who have been in power far longer, although most retain control through what are widely
                    considered sham elections.

                    These are five countries where non-royal heads of state have been in power longest.</p>

                <p>President Nursultan Nazarbayev has been in power since 1984 and assumed the newly created office of
                    president in 1990, when Kazakhstan split from the Soviet Union. He was re-elected in 2015 with about
                    98
                    percent of the vote; human rights and democracy groups label the country an “authoritarian regime.”
                    Still, Kazakhstan has emerged as a U.S. strategic ally, and Nazarbayev visited the White House in
                    January.</p>
